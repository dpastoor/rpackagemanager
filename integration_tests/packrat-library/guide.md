# packrat-library
tags: packrat-lockfile

## Description

Environment to test functionality of packrat library, i.e., if  "Library" is not defined and Lockfile->Type is "packrat",
then the "Library" path is defined like a packrat library path:
   packrat/lib/{PLATFORM}/{R VERSION}

## Expected behavior

If the "packrat-like" folder does not exist, an error is shown:

```
pkgr install
INFO[0000] R Version 3.6.0                              
FATA[0000] package library not found at given library path  libraryPath=packrat/lib/x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0/3.6.0
```

If the "packrat-like" folder does exist, packages are installed to the packrat-folder and the output is similar to:

```
pkgr install
